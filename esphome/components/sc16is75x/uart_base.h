///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// @brief This is an helper class that provides a simple ring buffers
/// that implements a FIFO function
///
/// This ring buffer is used to buffer the exchanges between the receiver
/// HW fifo and the client. Usually to read characters you first
/// check if bytes were received and if so you read them.
/// There is a problem if you try to the received bytes one by one.
/// If the registers are located on the chip everything is fine but with a
/// device like the wk2132 these registers are remote and therefore accessing
/// them requires several transactions on the IÂ²C bus which is relatively slow.
/// One solution would be for the client to check the number of bytes available
/// and to read them all using the read_array() method. Unfortunately
/// most client I have reviewed are reading one character at a time in a
/// while loop which is the most inefficient way of doing things.
/// Therefore the solution I have chosen to implement is to
/// store received bytes locally in a buffer as soon as they arrive. With
/// this solution the bytes are stored locally and therefore accessible
/// very quickly when requested one by one.

/// are missing the critical status information and therefore are even
